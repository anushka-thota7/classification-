# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze the key factors that affect wine quality and build a model that can accurately classify wine samples into different quality categories.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains several chemical attributes such as acidity, sugar content, pH, sulphates, and alcohol percentage.  
Using these features, machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, and **Logistic Regression** are trained to predict wine quality ratings.
